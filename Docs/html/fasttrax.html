<A NAME="Overview">
<h3>Overview</h3>

FastTraX is a simple utility to find files. It closely resembles the Find File tool
 on Windows.<br>
FastTrax gives a number of edit controls to allow you to enter criteria for finding
 a file. These are separated into three panels described below.<br>
When you click the &nbsp;<code>Find</code>&nbsp; button, FastTraX will search
 within the specified location, for files which match <STRONG>all</STRONG>
 the criteria you have specified. Edit boxes that are empty are ignored.<br>
If you require more flexibility than this, please look at
 <A HREF="trax.html">TraX</A>.

<hr>

<A NAME="NamePanel">
<h3>The <code>Name</code> Panel</h3>

When FastTraX opens, it starts in the <code>Name</code> Panel.<br>
This panel allows you to specify
<UL>
<LI>Where you wish to search
<LI>What filename to search for
<LI>Whether to include subdirectories
</UL>

<p>
<h5><b>Where to search</b></h5>

There is a PopUp menu on the <code>Name</code> panel labeled <code>Find in:</code><br>
If you open FastTrax by dragging a folder onto its icon, or by using the "Open With"
 menu in Tracker, then this Popup will start with the selected folder. Otherwise
 it will start with the 'root' directory, &quot;/&quot;.<br>
Selecting this menu will bring up a list of folders to choose from, or you can
 choose your own.<br>
At the top of the menu is the root folder, and all your mounted disks. If the only
 disk you have mounted is your main BeOS disk, then this will be labeled "/boot/"
 and no other disks will be visible. If you have any other mounted disks (of any
 filesystem type) they will also be visible.<br>
Below the disks are a number of important folders:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>/boot/home</CODE> - your home directory
<LI><CODE>/boot/home/Desktop</CODE> - your Desktop
<LI><CODE>/boot/beos</CODE> - the BeOS system folder
<LI><CODE>/boot/optional</CODE> - the optional items folder (if installed)
</UL>
Below this is the &quot;<CODE>other...</CODE>&quot; option. Selecting this
 will bring up an <code>Open</code> window to allow you to select any other folder
 you wish.

<p>
<h5><b>What the file is named</b></h5>

The <i>EditBox</i> labeled <Code>Named:</Code> is where you can type in the name
 of the file you are looking for.<br>
This field uses <i><code><A HREF="glob.html">globs</A></code</i>, thus to seach
 for all gif images you could put <code>*.gif</code> into this box.<br>
To search for all files containing "be" in their name, try <code>*be*</code><br>
All names used are <i>case-insensitive</i>, thus <code>*.txt</code> is the same
 as <code>*.TXT</code> or <code>*.TxT</code>&nbsp; (etc)<br>
You can leave this field blank to find all matching files, regardless of name.

<p>
<h5><b>Include Sub-Directories</b></h5>
Leaved this box checked to have the search descend into subdirectories of the
 selected folder.<br>
Uncheck it to search only at one level.

<p>
<hr>

<A NAME="FilePanel">
<h3>The <code>File</code> Panel</h3>

The <Code>File</Code> panel is where you can place restrictions on the size, type
 and contents of a file.<br>
To access the <code>File</code> panel, click the <code>File</code> button at the top
 of the FastTraX window.<br>
The fields on this panel are:
<UL>
<LI><Code>Containing Text</Code> where you can search for a file based on its
 contents.
<LI><Code>Size at least</Code> , <Code>Size less than</Code> where you can place
 restrictions on the size of the files you wish to find.
<LI><Code>Kind</Code>, allowing you to search for a Folder, Plain File or Symbolic
 Link.
</UL>

<p>
<h5><b><CODE>Containing Text</CODE></b></h5>

In this Edit Box, you can type in some text that you wish to search for.<br>
This must be plain text - the seach does not use globs or regular expressions.<br>
Putting text in this field will also cause the search to be restricted to plain
 files only, as only these can contain text. (NB: The &quot;<code>Kind</code>&quot;
 popup will NOT change to indicate this, but so that the search will work correctly,
 the restriction will be added when you commence the search)<br>

<p>
<h5><b><CODE>Size</CODE>...</b></h5>

There are two Edit Boxes for entering a file size in. You can use either, or both.<br>
<CODE>Size at least:</CODE>&nbsp;-&nbsp the minimum size of the file to find.<br>
<CODE>Size less than:</CODE>&nbsp;-&nbsp the maximum size of the file to find.<br>
As you can see, by placing the lower bound on the size in the top box, and the upper
 bound in the bottom box, you can specify that the files found are to fall within a
 given range of sizes.
<TABLE>
<TD><IMG SRC="gfx/ft_size.gif">
<TD><i>eg</i> The screenshot to the left shows how to search for a file that is
 between 50kB and 200kB in size.
</TABLE>

<p>
<h5><b><CODE>Kind</CODE></b></h5>

The <CODE>Kind</CODE> PopUp allows you to specify the kind of filesystem entity you
 are looking for.<br>
This must be one of <CODE>File</CODE> , <CODE>Folder</CODE> , <CODE>Link</CODE> or
 &quot;Any&quot;<br>
You cannot search for <i>Filetypes</i> in this version of FastTraX.<br>

<p>
<hr>

<A NAME="DatePanel">
<h3>The <code>Date</code> Panel</h3>

The <Code>Date</Code> Panel is where you can add criteria about the modification
 or creation date of files.<br>
There are four edit boxes on this panel. All four use <code>parsedate</code> which is
 a function in the BeOS to convert a string into a date. <code>parsedate</code>
 understands a large number of formats. Some examples are:
<UL>
<LI><code>today</code> which will give you today at 0:00
<LI><code>today 3:15am </code> which will give you today at 3:15
<LI><code>last saturday 15:34:11</code> (3:34 PM (and 11 seconds) on the preceding Saturday)
<LI><code>this monday</code> (the coming monday, 0:00)
</UL>
Note though, that <code>parsedate</code> has some problems with commas in the
 strings, so you are better leaving them out. If FastTraX cannot understand the
 date you enter, it will being up an alert to inform you.
<p>
As with the <CODE>Size</CODE> section of the <A HREF="#FilePanel"><CODE>File</CODE>
 Panel</A>, there are two edit boxes for the each for <code>Modified</code> and
 <code>Created</code>. This allows you to specify a range of times to search, thus
 if you know that you changed the file yesterday, you can enter<br>
<IMG SRC="gfx/ft_mod.gif" ALIGN="center"><br>
because &quot;<code>yesterday</code>&quot; will default to 0:00 yesterday, and
&quot;<code>today</code>&quot; will default to 0:00 today.
