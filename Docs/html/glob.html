Sorry, this part of the documentation hasn't been completed.
Please mail <A HREF="mailto:zodsoft@kagi.com">me</A> if you need more info.
<p>
A good shell tutorial should be able to explain the use of globs to you.<br>
<A HREF="http://www.beforever.com">BeForever</A> has a Bash tutorial which
 might give you some help.<br>
The quick tips are:
<UL>
<LI><code>*</code> matches any string
<LI><code>?</code> matches any character
<LI><code>[xy]</code> matches an <code>x</code> or <code>y</code>
<LI><code>[a-zA-Z]</code> matches any alphabetic character
</UL>
<i>eg</i> <code>*9907[01]*[0-9]?</code> will match any filename of the form:
<UL>
<LI>Any number of characters
<LI>Followed by '9907'
<LI>Followed by either a 0 or 1
<LI>Followed by any number of characters
<LI>Then ending in a digit, followed by another character
</UL>
And yes, this sequence of characters actually has meaning to me.
