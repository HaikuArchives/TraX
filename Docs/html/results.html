<BODY BGCOLOR="black" TEXT="white" LINK="yellow" VLINK="#00aaff">

Due to various time constraints, I am not able to provide great details here,
 but some quick tips are:
<UL>
<LI>
	Standard SHIFT, and OPTION clicking work, but OutlineRectDragging doesn't
	(IMHO this is a deficiency in the BeOS ListView)
<LI>
	You can drag items as if from Tracker (more or less)
<LI>
	Double clicking an Item opens it
<LI>
	CTRL-Double clicking an item will (attempt to) open its parent folder and
		select the item
<LI>
	ALT-Double clicking an item will behave like CTRL Double clicking, except for
	    folders, where it will open the item.
</UL>
