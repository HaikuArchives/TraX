	TraX

TraX is a utility to assist in finding files on the BeOS.
Although BeOS ships with a very powerful query mechanism, this feature has some flaws.

1) It can only search on  Filesystems that keep indices. ie, It only works for BeOS (BFS) disks, not MacOS (HFS) or Windows (FAT) disks.

2) It cannot seach within certain folders only, but must search across the whole disk.

3) It cannot search for text included in the file.

TraX can do the above - and more.

TraX is not a "query" tool. It does not keep a database of files and attributes.
It is a tradition find tool. It searches the disk every time, looking for files that meet your criteria.
The find-criteria are not BeOS specific, and it does not (currently) search attributes.

TraX comes in two varieties.
FastTraX is similar to the Windows find tool. Windows users should find its features very familiar.

TraX is a cross between the UNIX "find" command the the MacOS "Find Files" tool. It has much of the power of "find" with a Mac-like interface (a Mac on steriods that is)
